ISCAS89 Format
==============

The *cframe* module, as well as other tools used in 18-765, use the ISCAS89 format to describe circuits. An ISCAS89 file is a series of text lines that each fall into one of the following three categories: comments, ports, and gates.

Comments
--------

A comment line is any line that starts with the "#" character. All of the characters after the "#" up to and including the next newline are considered comments and are therefore ignored. For example::

  # This is a comment

Ports
-----

A port line describes the primary inputs and primary outputs of a circuit. A port line has the following form::

  port-type(port-name)

Where **port-type** can be either "input" or "INPUT" for primary inputs and "output" or "OUTPUT" for primary outputs. For example::

  input(a)
  INPUT(b)
  output(y)
  OUTPUT(z)

Describes two primary inputs *a* and *b* and two primary outputs *y* and *z* for a circuit.

Gates
-----

A gate line describes a gate type and its input-output relationship. A gate line takes the following form::

  gate-output = gate-type(gate-input1, gate-input2...)

Where **gate-output** is the output of the gate being described, **gate-type** is the type of gate, and the list **(gate-input1, gate-input2...)** are the inputs of the gate. The following are allowed values for **gate-type**: *and, nand, or, nor, buff, xor, xnor*. Note that *xor* and *xnor* gates are required to have two inputs, and *not* and *buff* are required to only have one input. The remaining gate types (*and, nand, or, nor*) can have any number of inputs. For example::

  p = and(q, r)
  s = or(t, u, v)
  a = xor(b, c)
  h = not(j)

Describes four gates of differing types along with the input-output relationships for each gate.

Fanout of more than one is allowed in the ISCAS89 format. However, note that there is no explicit representation of a fanout branch in the ISCAS89 circuit description. Consider the example circuit c9.bench shown below:

.. figure:: images/c9_fanout.png
   :alt: c9.bench
   :align: center

   Diagram of example circuit c9.bench

This circuit can be described in the ISCAS89 format as follows::

  # c9.bench
  input(a)
  input(b)
  input(t)
  input(u)

  output(e)
  output(f)
  
  s = and(a, b)
  e = or(s, t)
  f = or(s, u)

Note that the fanout from *s* is implicit in the ISCAS89 circuit description. While there is no ISCAS89 format for specifying fanout branches, for this class we will use the following convention::

  stem->branch

Thus, the branch from stem gate *s* to branch gate *e* would be represented as *s->e*.
